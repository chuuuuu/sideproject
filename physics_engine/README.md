# Physics Engine
generally, there're three part of physical engine:
1. simulation
2. collision detection
  - there're two stage for collision detection
    - broad phase
    - narrow phase
3. constrained simulation
  - Some examples of constraints are
    - joints
    - non-penetration constraints
      - we can do collision response with this
