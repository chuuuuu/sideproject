# Design Pattern
there're many design patterns. however, all of them follow the SOLID principle. it's not necessary to use design pattern. moreover, you need to avoid over-design!

- Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
- Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done so.
- Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions to problems, not solutions finding problems; so don't overthink.
- If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior; or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.
