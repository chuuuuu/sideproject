# GraphQL

## `graphql-yoga`
How does `graphql-yoga` compare to `apollo-server` and other tools?
As mentioned above, `graphql-yoga` is built on top of a variety of other packages, such as `graphql.js`, `express` and `apollo-server`. Each of these provides a certain piece of functionality required for building a GraphQL server.

Using these packages individually incurs overhead in the setup process and requires you to write a lot of boilerplate. `graphql-yoga` abstracts away the initial complexity and required boilerplate and lets you get started quickly with a set of sensible defaults for your server configuration.

`graphql-yoga` is like `create-react-app` for building GraphQL servers.

## subscription
Apollo Client subscriptions most commonly communicate over WebSocket, via the community-maintained `subscriptions-transport-ws` library.

## `reflection-metadata`
Decorators add the ability to augment a class and its members as the class is defined, through a declarative syntax.
Traceur attaches annotations to a static property on the class.
Languages like C# (.NET), and Java support attributes or annotations that add metadata to types, along with a reflective API for reading metadata.
