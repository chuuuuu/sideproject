# Paypal Practice

In this practice, I follow the steps provide by the [paypal official site](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/archive/checkout/how-to/server-integration/) to create a simple online payment api.

## Work flow

Your buyer clicks the Pay Now button in the PayPal Checkout flow.
Buyer reviews their order and clicks the Agree & Pay button.
The browser calls your server.
Your server calls the PayPal API to execute the payment.
You show a payment receipt page to the buyer.

## Sandbox

you can create a sandbox environment for test / development mode from [here](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications)

and you can create sandbox buyer account from [here](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts)
